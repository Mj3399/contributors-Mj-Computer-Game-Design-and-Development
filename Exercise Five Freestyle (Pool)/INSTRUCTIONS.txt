The cue ball is purposefully white to match the color of the other balls to increase the difficulty.
o What their behavior is supposed to be:
The walls do not move, nor do the holes, the white balls should be knocked around by collisions and dissappear when coming into contact with the holes
The cue ball moves by clicking to drag and aim and then is launched by realising the click
Score increases when the white balls are knocked into holes and is decreased when the cue ball is knocked into the holes.
o What the playerâ€™s controls are:
