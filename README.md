# Computer-Game-Design-and-Development
Compilation of the things I worked on in CS 376 Computer Game Design and Development.

For the games note that I only coded the sections outlined in the instructions pdf, I included all the files including the starter code so that if anyone desired they could download and run the games successfully.
